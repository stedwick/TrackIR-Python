Attempting to reverse engineer the TrackIR protocol to read the camera with Python without needing the NaturalPoint drivers.

This is all AI generated with Cursor.

So far, I've be able to turn the camera on and receive binary data. But I haven't decoded the format of the images.

This definitely seems possible to do, I've only spent one or two days on it.
