# TrackIR-Python

A Python implementation for reverse engineering the TrackIR protocol to read camera data directly from TrackIR hardware without requiring NaturalPoint's proprietary drivers.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to provide an open-source alternative to NaturalPoint's TrackIR software by directly interfacing with TrackIR hardware via USB communication. The implementation is based on reverse engineering efforts and references the LinuxTrack open-source project.

**Current Status**: Experimental - Successfully initializes the camera, controls LEDs, and receives binary data streams. Image format decoding and tracking algorithms are in active development.

## ✨ Features

- **Direct USB Communication**: Bypasses proprietary drivers using pyusb
- **Real-time Data Streaming**: Captures and processes tracking data in real-time
- **LED Control**: Manages IR and status LEDs for optimal tracking
- **OpenCV Visualization**: Real-time display of tracking data with FPS monitoring
- **Protocol Analysis**: Comprehensive logging of USB communication for debugging
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12+** - Core runtime
- **pyusb 1.3.0+** - Low-level USB device communication
- **OpenCV 4.10.0+** - Computer vision and visualization
- **NumPy 2.2.1+** - Numerical computing for image processing

## 🔧 Core Architecture

### TrackIR Class

The main `TrackIR` class handles all hardware interaction:

#### Key Components

- **USB Device Management**: Device discovery, endpoint configuration, kernel driver handling
- **Protocol Implementation**: Command sequences based on LinuxTrack reverse engineering
- **Data Streaming**: Real-time frame capture and parsing
- **LED Control**: IR and status LED management
- **Visualization**: ASCII art and OpenCV-based display

#### USB Communication Flow

1. **Device Initialization**: Find device, reset, configure endpoints
2. **Command Sequence**: Send initialization commands based on LinuxTrack protocol
3. **LED Activation**: Turn on IR LEDs for tracking illumination
4. **Data Streaming**: Continuous reading of 4-byte data packets
5. **Frame Parsing**: Convert raw USB data into visualization-ready format

### Data Format

Based on reverse engineering, the TrackIR uses this data structure:

- **4-byte packets**: `[vline, hstart, hstop, delimiter]`
- **vline**: Vertical line number (0-95, with extension bit for values > 255)
- **hstart/hstop**: Horizontal pixel start/end positions for detected features
- **delimiter**: Control byte with extension flags

## 🔍 Development

### USB Communication Debugging

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:

- All USB commands and responses logged in hex format
- Device information and endpoint details
- Real-time data stream analysis
- Error handling with detailed USB error codes

### Protocol Reference

Commands are based on LinuxTrack's implementation:

```python
# Example initialization sequence
init_sequence = [
    [0x12],           # Request version
    [0x14, 0x01],     # Initialize
    [0x14, 0x02],     # Start streaming
    [0x10, 0x02],     # Set data format
    [0x11, 0x80],     # Set exposure
    # ... more commands
]
```

### Visualization Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Read 4-byte USB packets in real-time
2. **Coordinate Mapping**: Convert packet data to pixel coordinates
3. **Image Generation**: Create OpenCV image with detected features
4. **Display**: Real-time window with FPS counter and scaling

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found

```bash
# Check USB connection
lsusb                           # Linux
system_profiler SPUSBDataType  # macOS

# Verify vendor/product ID (should be 131d:0155)
# Try different USB ports
# Ensure TrackIR software is not running
```

### USB Permission Issues

```bash
# Linux: Add user to appropriate groups
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER  # Then logout/login

# macOS: May require elevated permissions
sudo python trackir.py
```

### No Data Reception

- Verify LED initialization commands succeeded
- Check device response to initialization sequence
- Monitor USB communication logs for error patterns
- Ensure proper endpoint configuration
